# Advanced Electrical Machines Mini Project

A 460-V, 25-hp. 60-Hz. four-pole. Y-connected wound-rotor induction motor has the
following impedances in ohms per phase referred to the stator circuit:
Rl = 0.641 0hm
Xl = 1.106 0hm
R2 = 0.3320hm
X2 = 0.464 0hm XM = 26.3 0hm
a. What is the maximum torque of this motor? At what speed and slip does it occur?
b. What is the starting torque of this motor?
c. When the rotor resistance is doubled. What is the speed at which the maximum
torque now occurs? What is the new starting torque of the motor?

Solve the numerical as well. Plot the torque-speed characteristics of this motor both with
the original rotor resistance and with the rotor resistance doubled using MATLAB.
(but i have done here using numpy and matplotlib)
